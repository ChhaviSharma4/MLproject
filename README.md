# Musical Instrument Classifier

Building a deep learning model to classify musical instrument from a sample of audio.

We first limit ourselves to fixed-length samples of single harmonic tone played by synthesized [MIDI instruments](https://www.midi.org/specifications/item/gm-level-1-sound-set)

## Datasets

- `data/mid-instruments.csv`

## Requirements

`Python 3.4 (eg. via Anaconda), Keras, TensorFlow etc.`

`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`
